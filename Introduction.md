# Playbook: Sales
Sales play a pioneering role in the journey of surviving and thriving of a company, thus as members of the sales team, we will be soldiers on the frontline, the backbone of business growth at Dwarves Foundation. 

We are making our history.


Scoring a big sale is never an easy task. It relies on a multitude of factors such as industry knowledge, business acumen, analytical skills, and the ability to read people. Especially, as for salespeople that are new to the industry or even the job, ramping up to the rewarding moment of closing a deal can be taken as a process of continuous trials and errors.


This playbook contains the best practices we have tested and the lessons we have learned to become who we are now, which particularly demonstrate the sales process at Dwarves Foundation and how we have handled it successfully. Also, it represents our achievements and our goal.

A kick-ass sales playbook prevents you from haphazard guessing when a question comes up. However, let’s make one thing clear that never can a playbook replace a real initial onboarding experience at the office. It paves you the way into Dwarves Foundation, but on top of that, your own inquiring mind will help you unlock the door, step into, explore, then share moments with other teammates. This will be much more fun.
