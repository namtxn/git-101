## Another" outsourcing company?
As SDRs, we were slapped with many straight “No” because the contacts thought that we were just “another” outsourcing company striving for their money and nothing else. So, the following will be a long talk to get clear ground on what we really are, thereby you have clues to explain when needed!


* In the past few years, almost outsourcing firms just spend 20% of times to complete 80% of the tasks. And the rest 80% time is supposed to optimize more 20% quality of product. However, in most cases, they don’t! It’s not their product. They can use this time to work for another client and grow their revenue. But we are NOT a traditional outsourcing agency. Many outsourcing companies handle the job with the attitude of a follower. They follow the paycheck mindset and that leaves the client with an ordinary standard built product. We don't do that here. Each and every single work at Dwarves Foundation is created with the spirit of craftsmanship. Pursuing the bar of top-notch quality gives us the urge to put dedication in every piece of work. 


* We offer remote engineers to work in innovation products. We make huge impact to their products, from the very beginning stage to the final, not take some modules and get paycheck back. Hands-on experience is expected to be collected whenever a Dwarf joins our game. By participating in every stage of the work and putting our feet in the client's shoes, we have our crew backed up by the best engineers in the market through the spirit of craftsmanship. 


As mentioned above, our team have certain standards for clients and pay good salaries for engineers, so they wholeheartedly work and develop products for clients. 

## Management/Operations Model
We are in GMT +7 when our clients stay in GMT -7, UTC -2, …. So our team has a special management/operation process to solve it. So it comes to 2 different times: working times and communicative times. Working times run in our normal working times like other companies ( for example 8 am - 5 pm, GMT +7). 


Besides, we choose the overlap times (communicative times) convenient for both sides (clients and our engineers) to meet, plan or discuss the problems occurring during the works. Communicative times usually run in our relaxing times (1 hours, 8-9 pm or 11-12 pm). We also do Agile and Scrum to deliver value to customers faster and with fewer headaches. All these effort warrants the best quality works delivered no matter how time zones deviation.
